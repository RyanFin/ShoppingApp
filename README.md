# ShoppingApp

Shopping Application for UCL Verification and Validation. Very simple example of unit testing and using test cases.

## Test Oracles
In this example the oracle is not the human (e.g. the developer would be the test oracle if he/she wrote print statements and had to determine by his or herself whether the 'actual' output generated by the program matches the 'expected' output), the oracle is the unit tests and the test suite using JUnit. JUnit is an oracle as it determines whether the actual output (delivered by the application) matches the expected output. It does this after the developer configures the unit tests. JUnit lets the developer know whether the behaviour of the program is correct; therefore removing this responsibility from the developer. Therefore, JUnit is a very useful tool to use for the validation (testing) of the application.
